Simulates a game of Nim, a strategy game where two players must remove marbles (or some other set of objects) from a pile. In order for a player to win, the other player must be forced to pick up the last marble. Games are always between a human player and a computer player. The computer player can be set to two difficulties: "Stupid Computer" will always select a random number of marbles to remove from the pile, while "Smart Computer" always employs the optimal Nim victory strategy.
